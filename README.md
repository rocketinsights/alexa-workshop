# Boston node.js meetup Alexa Workshop

### Part 4

The goal of part 4 is to add support for the echo show. In this branch the code to complete the two open TODOs from part 3 are complete and an initial template to show a star wars character has been implemented.

### Prerequisites

* Completed part 3.

### Next steps

* Check out the documentation [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/display-interface-reference.html)
* Add support for a different template type. For example the [ListTemplate2](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/display-interface-reference.html#listtemplate2)
* Add support to the post callback to not send the template if the user is not on a display device.
* Add support for when the user selects an input on the screen. See docs [here](https://github.com/alexa-js/alexa-app#display-element-selected).

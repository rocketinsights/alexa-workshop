# Boston node.js meetup Alexa Workshop

### Part 3

The goal of part 3 is to layer in an actual qusetion and answer. This will still be focus on voice only. The current code will ask a single question and then say whether or not the answer is right. There are two spots in the `intents.js` file for you to flush out. Specifically, randomize the questions and don't repeat them. Also, keep the session open and keeping asking questions until they are all asked.

### Prerequisites

* Completed part 2.

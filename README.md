# Boston node.js meetup Alexa Workshop

### Part 1

Welcome to the boston node.js Alexa workshop. In this four part series we will create a game for guessing the correct star wars character for the Amazon Echo from scratch. This workshop is designed to get you started with the basics and then as a group we will decide how to augment it with the remaining time.

Each part is setup as a feature branch, with a README that is specific to each section. Now lets have some fun!

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 6.10.1 installed locally.
* Github account.
* Basical understanding of javascript.
* An [Alexa Developer account](developer.amazon.com/alexa)

### Getting started

* `yarn` or `npm install`
* `yarn test` or `npm test`

### What now?

When you ran your test you should have seen an error of "Expected spy say to have been called with [ 'Welcome to star wars trivia.' ] but actual calls were [ 'oh no! fix me!' ]." Dig into the code and get this spec to pass. Take the opportunity to follow the code path.
